Add and track resources

Add potions to 'Home Brewin' section

NTH:

1. Title folds up as you go down, comes back down after scrolling to top
Both Nav and Resource button stay visible whole time

2. Change resource cost. Make "Resource Cost xx Gold" text, and add a button next to that says "Learn?" or "Add to Brewin'?"

3. Add logic that won't let resource value go into negative number

4. Add logic that will dynamically add any potion spell card to "Home Brewin'" section, using event delegation

5. Add logic that will limit the number of WIP potions at a time

6. Add logic that will not let user add a potion from "Potions" page to "Home Brewin'" if maximum Potions are in flight.

7. Add way for user to track the days and scores for each potion in flight on the HB page.

8. Add logic to display roll inputs for each roll based on the number of days a potion need (ex potion takes two days, two form inputs to track )

9. Change logic so added potions are added to same object and removed when user "succeeds" or "fails" the potion
